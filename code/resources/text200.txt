I have recently completed a Bachelorsâ€™s Degree in nursing and I am currently looking for suitable long-term employment.
I am a hardworking person with a great personality benchmarked by excellent interpersonal skills which have helped me score great successes in the past.
While at college I held several practical exposures at different hospitals, which I received favorable comments from staff and the management.
I have only recently moved to this area.
Your institution was brought to my attention by one of my instructors at college, who said that you are currently hiring additional staff due to an increase in patient numbers.
Your record of providing quality and timely services to patients makes me desire to be part of your team.
If there is a suitable vacancy for me, please let me know.
I will be grateful to speak to you at any time.
I am enthusiastic about exploring opportunities with your institution and I look forward to meeting you.
