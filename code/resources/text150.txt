Obesity rates in school-aged children continue growing and influencing their development.
In addition to personal concerns and social judgments, overweight and obese children are at risk for long-term health consequences, including cardiovascular problems, metabolic changes, and additional comorbidities (Karp & Gessell, 2015).
Today, it is not enough to recognize and control this problem.
It is high time for schools to think about the interventions they choose to protect children and remove as many obesity-related factors as possible.
Healthy food like salads and fish should replace fast food, and fresh juices and water must be offered instead of soda or Coca-Cola.
In addition to healthy eating, physical activities and education are to be promoted.
Many children remain unaware of how to protect their health and avoid obesity, so the task of schools is to increase awareness and contribute to healthy lifestyles.
Obesity is not a disease anymore but a social burden.
